El Pais English refers to the \"fourth anniversary\" of the \"full-scale invasion.\" The Straits Times states an announcement was made \"exactly four years since Russia's invasion.\" El Pais English also refers to the conflict as the \"fifth year of war.\"\n\nDISAGREEMENTS:\nNo substantive contradictions identified.\n\nFRAMING DIFFERENCES:\nThe sources frame the anniversary of the war through different lenses, focusing on distinct aspects of the ongoing conflict.\n\nLe Monde frames the war primarily by its human toll, using stark language like \"worst bloodbath in Europe since 1945\" and \"colossal scale of the human toll\" to emphasize the approximately 500,000 deaths.\n\nEl Pais English frames the anniversary as a period of military \"stalemate on the battlefield\" and highlights external political dynamics, specifically \"pressure from Trump\" and Washington pushing for a \"ceasefire agreement.\"\n\nThe Straits Times frames the anniversary as a moment for international partners to reaffirm their backing, noting that Britain announced a support package \"exactly four years since Russia's invasion.\"\n\nOther sources focus on current and future developments rather than the anniversary itself. France 24 frames the situation around upcoming diplomatic talks. The New York Times frames it in the context of Ukraine's long-term strategic goal to \"Secure Peace\" by joining the EU. The Guardian frames a specific aspect of the conflict by reporting that Kenyans have been \"lured to fight for Russia,\" suggesting deception in recruitment efforts.\n\nKEY UNKNOWNS:\nThe provided extractions do not clarify the basis for Le Monde's casualty figure of \"around 500,000 deaths,\" nor do they detail the methodology used for this assessment beyond mentioning \"off-battlefield efforts and cross-referencing public data.\" The nature of the \"pressure from Trump\" for a ceasefire, mentioned by El Pais English, is not detailed. The specifics of the British aid package mentioned by The Straits Times are not provided. The identities of the \"rogue\" agencies recruiting Kenyans, as reported by The Guardian, remain unspecified.",
        "ChatGPT": "AGREED FACTS:\nMultiple sources (El Pais English and The Straits Times) confirm that the Russia-Ukraine war has reached its fourth anniversary, marking the beginning of its fifth year. Both refer to the full-scale invasion as having started four years ago. Both also mention the ongoing nature of the conflict at this anniversary. France 24 and The Straits Times both reference ongoing or upcoming diplomatic and support efforts related to the war, though the details differ (France 24: diplomatic meetings; The Straits Times: UK aid package). \n\nDISAGREEMENTS:\nNo substantive contradictions identified. All sources report on different aspects of the conflict or provide different details, but none make incompatible claims about the same fact or event.\n\nFRAMING DIFFERENCES:\nLe Monde frames the war as a humanitarian catastrophe, using phrases like \"worst bloodbath in Europe since 1945\" and \"colossal scale of the human toll,\" emphasizing the scale of casualties and the difficulty in counting them. El Pais English frames the situation geopolitically, focusing on \"stalemate on the battlefield\" and \"Washington pushing for a ceasefire agreement,\" and refers to \"frontline attrition and pressure from Trump.\" France 24 takes a neutral, event-driven approach, highlighting \"upcoming meeting between the Ukrainian negotiator and US envoys\" and \"fresh round of trilateral talks with Russia,\" with little emotive language. The Straits Times uses factual, commemorative framing, emphasizing the \"exactly four years since Russia's invasion\" timing of the UK's support announcement. The New York Times frames Ukraine's EU aspirations as both critical and fraught, using phrases like \"critical to Kyiv\u2019s future,\" \"obstacles abound,\" and \"compromises might forever change how the union works,\" focusing on the long-term political implications. The Guardian frames the recruitment of Kenyans for Russia as illicit and deceptive, using terms like \"lured\" and \"rogue agencies,\" emphasizing the scale and illegality of the recruitment.\n\nKEY UNKNOWNS:\nThe actual, independently verified number of casualties in the war remains unclear, as only Le Monde provides an estimate and acknowledges the difficulty in verification. The precise impact and effectiveness of international diplomatic efforts and aid packages are not detailed. The extent and nature of child involvement in the conflict, as referenced in the initial topic, are not addressed in any extraction. The scale and mechanisms of foreign fighter recruitment beyond the Kenyan example are not explored. The specific obstacles to Ukraine's EU membership and the nature of potential compromises are not elaborated. The direct effect of Washington's push for a ceasefire and the influence of US domestic politics (e.g., \"pressure from Trump\") are not clarified."

      "investigation_raw": "WHAT I FOUND:\nThe conflict in Ukraine is being framed around two different start dates: the full-scale invasion in February 2022 and the initial annexation of Crimea and conflict in Donbas in 2014. As of February 2026, this marks the fourth anniversary of the full-scale invasion, placing the war in its fifth year. Research has provided specific details on previously vague topics, including a recent \u00a313 billion British military aid package and a US-led diplomatic push for a ceasefire, which includes a proposal for Ukrainian forces to withdraw from parts of the Donbas region. Furthermore, there is evidence of increased militarization of youth, with Ukrainian teenagers enrolling in defense courses and reports of Russia implementing military training in schools in occupied territories.\n\nDOES THIS CHANGE THE STORY?\nYES \u2014 The research adds significant context and detail to several key aspects of the war that were previously vague. It clarifies the nature of the diplomatic pressures, the scale of international aid, and the disturbing trend of youth militarization. While the initial coverage accurately reported the anniversary, it lacked the substantive details that my findings provide, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the current state of the conflict.\n\nIF YES \u2014 STORY IMPACT:\nThe reader should understand that the \"fifth year\" of the war is characterized by a complex interplay of intensified international diplomacy with specific, and potentially divisive, peace proposals, alongside a significant ramping up of military support from key allies like the UK. Moreover, the future of the conflict is being shaped by the direct involvement of a new generation, as both sides are preparing their youth for a prolonged struggle.",

      "editorial": "**The Last Stand Playbook: Trump's SOTU as Electoral Gambit**\n\n**REAL MOTIVATIONS**\n\nTrump's two-hour marathon served dual purposes, but the balance tilted heavily toward electoral positioning. While all election-year SOTUs blend governing and campaigning, this speech's defensive tone\u2014justifying existing policies rather than proposing new legislative initiatives\u2014reveals an administration operating from weakness. With \"sliding poll numbers and low approval ratings\" documented across sources, Trump deployed calculated populism: pairing hardline immigration rhetoric with the broadly popular stock-trade ban to retain base enthusiasm while appealing to reform-minded independents.\n\nCongressional Democrats orchestrated visible protests for political theater designed to generate contrast ahead of midterms. But the critical missing dynamic is Republican establishment reactions. The stock-trade ban potentially creates tension with GOP donors and financial sector allies, suggesting Trump prioritized his electoral needs over party unity\u2014a risky gambit that could complicate Republican messaging.\n\n**SUBSTANCE VS. PERFORMANCE**\n\nThe speech's record length maximized media coverage while demonstrating vitality to counter age concerns. Trump's specific approach\u2014combining immigration hardline rhetoric with popular anti-corruption positioning\u2014represents a more sophisticated strategy than Obama's focused deficit pivot or Clinton's targeted crime emphasis. This dual-track messaging attempted to energize populist sentiment while providing cover for suburban voters uncomfortable with pure grievance politics.\n\nThe Iran condemnation, however, represents rhetorical posturing without substantive engagement strategy. The absence of detailed Middle East policy initiatives, combined with the speech's domestic focus, suggests symbolic tough-talk rather than genuine regional commitment\u2014contradicting any claims of \"continued engagement.\"\n\n**INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS**\n\nThe speech's domestic focus carries significant foreign policy signals. Trump's tariff defense and documented avoidance of China details likely registered with trading partners as continued economic nationalism. This reinforces perceptions of American inward focus, potentially affecting alliance dynamics and trade negotiations as allies interpret SOTU addresses as policy previews.\n\n**HISTORICAL CONTEXT**\n\nUnlike previous embattled presidents who pivoted to specific policy areas, Trump attempted broader coalition management. The combination of base-mobilizing immigration rhetoric with cross-party stock-trade reform represents calculated risk: appealing to populist anti-corruption sentiment while maintaining core constituency support. This reflects an administration expecting constrained post-election circumstances but still seeking to expand its coalition.\n\n**EXPECTATION GAPS**\n\nTrump expects his policy mix will limit suburban defections while maintaining base turnout. Given documented polarized reactions, this seems optimistic\u2014the speech likely reinforced existing perceptions rather than changing them. Democrats expect their protest theater will generate momentum, betting on symbolic resistance over substantive alternatives.\n\n**THE BROADER DYSFUNCTION**\n\nThis spectacle powerfully illustrates how SOTU addresses increasingly function as campaign events rather than governing documents. Both parties prioritize performative positioning because their constituencies reward confrontation over compromise. Trump's marathon performance and Democratic protests demonstrate that institutional norms have yielded to partisan theater.\n\nThis represents a troubling symptom of the growing gap between campaigning and governing. When the presidency's most visible annual address becomes primarily about electoral positioning rather than policy leadership, it reveals how campaign dynamics now dominate governing institutions, leaving substantive challenges unaddressed while both sides perform for their respective audiences.",

Several sources agree that the speech was notable for its length, with South China Morning Post, Fox News, and Toronto Star describing it as either \"record-breaking,\" \"nearly two hours long,\" or \"the longest of its kind.\" Multiple sources (South China Morning Post, DW News) note that the address served as a preview or rallying point ahead of the November midterm elections. Several sources (Toronto Star, France 24, South China Morning Post, Al Jazeera) confirm that Trump focused on economic issues and domestic policy, including immigration. MarketWatch specifically confirms that Trump called for Congress to stop insider trading among lawmakers, and that this received applause from both Democrats and Republicans. Al Jazeera and In These Times both confirm that Trump used the speech to highlight his successes and did not advocate for taxing the ultra-rich.\n\nDISAGREEMENTS:\nNo substantive contradictions identified.\n\nFRAMING DIFFERENCES:\nSources frame the address in notably different ways. The Toronto Star uses the phrase \"controversial immigration tactics and global tariffs\" and describes the address as \"record-breaking,\" emphasizing controversy and spectacle. South China Morning Post frames Trump's message as one of \"economic strength and global leadership,\" and highlights the \"notable absence of a direct mention of China,\" suggesting strategic restraint. France 24 calls the speech \"surprisingly disciplined\" and notes it \"stuck mainly to a script that focused heavily on domestic issues,\" implying an unexpected level of control from Trump. Fox News emphasizes partisan division, quoting Republicans calling Trump a \"historic leader\" and Democrats calling the speech \"humiliating,\" and describes the speech as the \"longest State of the Union in history.\" Al Jazeera uses neutral language, saying Trump \"talked up his successes\" and \"railed against Democrats.\" MarketWatch focuses on a specific policy proposal\u2014Trump's call for a stock-trade ban for Congress\u2014and highlights bipartisan applause. In These Times frames the address as ignoring \"taxing the ultra-rich,\" which it calls \"an effective solution to our economic emergency,\" and criticizes Trump for \"steering clear\" of this issue. DW News frames the address as \"a preview of the message Republicans intend to send ahead of November's mid-term elections,\" focusing on its strategic political role.\n\nKEY UNKNOWNS:\nThe coverage does not clarify the specific content or details of Trump's proposed policies beyond general references to immigration, tariffs, economic strength, and the stock-trade ban. There is little information on the factual accuracy or fact-checks of Trump's claims during the address. The sources do not provide details on public reaction beyond partisan responses, nor do they address the impact or legislative prospects of the policy proposals mentioned. The reasoning behind the length of the speech and whether it was effective in achieving its political goals is not explored. The degree to which Trump's address may have influenced public opinion or the midterm election outlook remains unaddressed."

      "investigation_raw": "1. WHAT I FOUND:\nThe news event described refers to a fictional State of the Union address by Donald Trump on February 24, 2026. This hypothetical speech is consistently reported as the longest in history, lasting nearly two hours. The address covered his administration's policies on immigration, tariffs, and foreign affairs, including the recent capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and tensions with Iran. The speech was delivered against a backdrop of low approval ratings and public skepticism about the economy.\n\n2. DOES THIS CHANGE THE STORY?\nYES \u2014 The initial coverage, while accurately reporting the event's occurrence and record-breaking length, largely omits critical analysis of the factual basis of Trump's statements and the specific details of public and political opposition. My research uncovered numerous fact-checks that challenge the accuracy of his claims regarding the economy and his administration's accomplishments. Furthermore, the public reaction was more than just partisan responses; it included organized counter-events and specific polling data indicating widespread disapproval of his policies and the direction of the country.\n\n3. IF YES \u2014 STORY IMPACT:\nThe reader should understand that while the speech was a significant media event due to its length, many of the claims made during the address are disputed by fact-checkers. Additionally, the public and political opposition to the address and the policies it promoted was more substantial and organized than the initial coverage might suggest.",

      "actions": [],
      "editorial": "**The Pre-Geneva Pressure Campaign: Military Leverage Meets Diplomatic Reality**\n\nThe current US-Iran escalation follows a familiar pattern: deploy overwhelming military force, generate crisis atmosphere, then position yourself as the reasonable party seeking negotiations. The 150+ aircraft deployment to Europe and the Middle East likely represents calculated coercion designed to extract maximum concessions at Geneva\u2014though this assessment must be weighed against alternative explanations including genuine strike preparation or regional deterrence signaling.\n\n**Motivations Behind the Military Theater**\n\nThe massive deployment serves multiple audiences simultaneously. The National Review's call for Congressional oversight on potential Iran military action reflects conservative constitutional concerns about executive war powers, not necessarily bipartisan endorsement of military options. This demand for legislative approval could actually constrain presidential action rather than legitimize it, representing institutional checks rather than political support for escalation.\n\nIran's response reveals its own calculated positioning. Dismissing US allegations of \"sinister nuclear ambitions\" as \"big lies\" while domestic student protests enter their fourth consecutive day shows a regime managing dual pressures. Tehran needs Geneva talks to succeed for economic relief, but cannot appear to capitulate under military threats without inflaming ongoing campus unrest that's testing regime control limits.\n\n**European Calculations and Missing Dynamics**\n\nThe analysis becomes more complex when examining European allies' independent interests. European nations invested heavily in the original Iran nuclear deal and suffered economically from Trump's 2018 withdrawal. They face a critical choice: align with US pressure tactics that mirror previous failed approaches, or attempt independent mediation that preserves their strategic autonomy while salvaging diplomatic solutions.\n\nEuropean response to current US military buildup\u2014whether alignment or hedging\u2014will significantly shape how both Washington and Tehran assess their negotiating positions. If Europeans distance themselves from military pressure, Iran gains confidence that US isolation limits escalation options. If they align, Tehran faces genuine coalition pressure.\n\n**Historical Pattern Recognition and Current Risks**\n\nThis mirrors aspects of the Obama administration's 2015 negotiations, where sanctions pressure preceded diplomatic breakthrough. But crucial differences emerge: the 2015 talks occurred during relative Iranian domestic stability, while current campus protests suggest a more fragile regime. The Obama precedent shows coercion can enable diplomacy when combined with credible off-ramps and face-saving mechanisms for both sides.\n\nHowever, the pattern also recalls the 2002-2003 Iraq buildup, where military deployment intended as diplomatic leverage acquired its own momentum. The gap between military posturing and actual negotiating goals can close unexpectedly, particularly when domestic political incentives favor demonstrating strength over patient diplomacy.\n\n**Dangerous Expectation Gaps**\n\nBoth sides appear to expect the other will capitulate first. US strategy assumes Iran will accept unfavorable Geneva terms rather than risk military confrontation. Iran seemingly expects the deployment represents pure bluff, banking on American war-weariness. These mutual expectations of capitulation often produce escalation rather than compromise.\n\n**High-Stakes Diplomatic Reality**\n\nWhile cynical observers might characterize Geneva talks as performative theater, the stakes suggest otherwise. Iran's economic desperation, ongoing domestic protests, and the US military deployment create genuine pressure for substantive negotiations. However, these same factors also create conditions where either side might prefer controlled confrontation to perceived capitulation.\n\nThe real question isn't whether talks will succeed, but whether the military pressure campaign enhances or undermines diplomatic prospects. The Obama precedent suggests coercion can work\u2014but only when combined with credible diplomatic incentives and face-saving exits.

Both sources also indicate that these tensions are occurring in the context of upcoming diplomatic talks (Toronto Star: critical talks in Geneva over Tehran's nuclear program; Al Jazeera: countries warning citizens to leave Iran amid potential US military strikes). The Guardian, while focused on regional diplomatic impact, also references ongoing US military actions in the region, though not specifically tied to Iran, and highlights debate about US interventions. All sources agree that US actions are prompting significant international and regional responses.\n\nDISAGREEMENTS:\nNo substantive contradictions identified. The sources focus on different aspects of the situation (Iran\u2019s response, regional diplomatic reaction, calls for Congressional debate, international warnings), but do not make incompatible claims about the same facts.\n\nFRAMING DIFFERENCES:\nThe Toronto Star frames the situation as Iran \"pushing back\" against US \"pressure tactics\" and describes the Geneva talks as \"critical,\" emphasizing Iranian resistance and the high stakes of diplomacy. The article uses phrases like \"pushed back\" and \"critical talks,\" and quotes Iranian officials calling US remarks \"big lies,\" highlighting Iran\u2019s official position.\n\nThe Guardian frames the escalation in terms of broader regional impact, focusing on how US interventions \"dominated\" debate at a Caricom summit and linking the situation to \"deadly military strikes against suspected drug boats and an oil blockade on Cuba.\" The emphasis is on the ripple effects of US actions and the collective regional response, rather than direct US-Iran dynamics.\n\nNational Review frames the issue as a matter for domestic US process, emphasizing the need for Congressional debate: \"A decision as consequential as this one deserves a real debate in Congress.\" This is an editorial framing, calling for legislative oversight rather than focusing on the international or diplomatic dimensions.\n\nAl Jazeera frames the situation around international concern for citizen safety, with the headline \"Which countries are urging citizens to leave Iran amid US threat of force?\" and content about countries issuing warnings \"amid potential US military strikes.\" This frames the US as a source of potential conflict and highlights the precautionary actions of other nations.\n\nKEY UNKNOWNS:\nWhich specific US military deployments are occurring, and where?

      "investigation_raw": "WHAT I FOUND:\nRecent reporting from early 2026 confirms a significant escalation in US-Iran tensions, centered around a major American military deployment to the Middle East and upcoming nuclear talks in Geneva. The military presence is described as the largest since the 2003 invasion of Iraq and includes at least two aircraft carrier strike groups, the USS Abraham Lincoln and the USS Gerald R. Ford. This show of force is intended to pressure Iran ahead of the third round of Omani-mediated talks in Geneva scheduled for Thursday, February 26, 2026, which will focus on Tehran's nuclear program. Amid fears of a potential military conflict, numerous countries\u2014including the United States, United Kingdom, India, Italy, Spain, Poland, Germany, Australia, and Canada\u2014have issued advisories urging their citizens to leave Iran.\n\nDOES THIS CHANGE THE STORY?\nNO \u2014 coverage is substantially accurate\n\nSTORY IMPACT:\nThe reader's understanding of the event is not fundamentally changed, but the research provides critical details and confirmation of the key elements. The initial prompt's claims of a major military deployment, diplomatic talks, and escalating tensions are all well-supported by multiple sources.

TechCrunch and Financial Times both identify the parties involved as the Pentagon and Anthropic.\n\nDISAGREEMENTS:\nNo substantive contradictions identified.\n\nFRAMING DIFFERENCES:\nThe sources frame the dispute with different levels of intensity and focus. TechCrunch frames it as an active, escalating conflict, using phrases like \"won't budge,\" \"escalates AI dispute,\" and \"high-stakes dispute.\" Financial Times also uses confrontational language, such as \"threatens to cut\" and \"showdown,\" but focuses more on the specific individuals involved, namely Hegseth and Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei. CNBC's framing is more neutral and business-focused, highlighting a recent change in the competitive landscape by noting Anthropic was the \"only AI company cleared\" until Elon Musk's xAI became the \"second.\"\n\nKEY UNKNOWNS:\nThe extractions do not specify what \"AI guardrails\" the Pentagon wants Anthropic to loosen or what \"potential penalties\" Anthropic might face beyond being cut from the supply chain. The specific military applications for Anthropic's technology that are under dispute are not detailed. The identity and role of \"Hegseth,\" mentioned by the Financial Times, are not clarified. The outcome of the Friday deadline mentioned by TechCrunch is not reported.",
        "ChatGPT": "AGREED FACTS:\nTechCrunch and Financial Times both report that there is an escalating dispute between the Pentagon and Anthropic regarding the use of Anthropic's AI technology. Both sources confirm that the Pentagon is threatening consequences for Anthropic if it does not comply with demands related to loosening AI guardrails or limiting restrictions on military use. TechCrunch specifies a deadline (Friday) and potential penalties, while Financial Times details that Hegseth is threatening to cut Anthropic from the Pentagon supply chain and that Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, was summoned to Washington for this issue. Both sources agree that Anthropic is resisting Pentagon pressure to alter its AI technology for military purposes.\n\nCNBC confirms that Anthropic was, until recently, the only AI company cleared to deploy its models on classified networks, and that xAI (Elon Musk's company) is now also cleared. This supports the context that Anthropic is a significant Pentagon vendor, as implied in the other sources.\n\nDISAGREEMENTS:\nNo substantive contradictions identified. The sources provide complementary details and perspectives rather than incompatible claims.\n\nFRAMING DIFFERENCES:\nTechCrunch frames the situation as a \"high-stakes dispute\" and emphasizes escalation, using phrases like \"won't budge,\" \"escalates AI dispute,\" and \"potential penalties.\" The article highlights broader implications, such as government leverage, vendor dependence, and investor confidence, focusing on the systemic impact of the conflict.\n\nFinancial Times uses confrontational language, describing the situation as a \"showdown\" and stating that Hegseth \"threatens to cut\" Anthropic from the supply chain. The article frames Anthropic's actions as \"trying to limit military use of its technology,\" positioning the company's stance as the central point of contention.\n\nCNBC adopts a more neutral, factual tone, focusing on the operational status of Anthropic and xAI regarding classified network deployment. Phrases like \"only AI company cleared\" and \"is now the second\" are used, with no explicit editorializing or broader implications discussed.\n\nKEY UNKNOWNS:\nThe specific demands the Pentagon is making of Anthropic regarding AI guardrails are not detailed. The nature of the \"potential penalties\" or what being \"cut from the supply chain\" would entail for Anthropic is unclear. The reasoning behind Anthropic's resistance\u2014beyond a general intent to limit military use\u2014is not elaborated. The potential impact on other vendors or the broader defense tech ecosystem is raised by TechCrunch but not substantiated with specifics. It is also unclear how xAI's new clearance status affects the Pentagon's leverage over Anthropic or the overall dispute."

Merco Press and DW News both identify \"El Mencho\" as the leader of CJNG. All sources agree that his death is linked to a recent wave of cartel violence in Mexico.

        "Gemini Pro": "AGREED FACTS:\nAt least 30 people died in the southeastern Brazilian state of Minas Gerais due to heavy rain, flooding, and landslides. This is confirmed by France 24, The Guardian, and NOS Nieuws. All four sources report that people are missing. France 24 and The Guardian specify 39 people are missing. The region experienced record rainfall this month, leading to a river bursting its banks and streets turning into \"raging currents of brown water,\" as reported by France 24 and The Guardian. The heavy rain occurred overnight, according to France 24 and The Guardian. NOS Nieuws specifies the heavy rainfall that caused floods occurred on Monday evening, while The Guardian notes people were still missing on Tuesday.\n\nDISAGREEMENTS:\nCONFIDENCE: MEDIUM. The number of missing people is reported differently. France 24 and The Guardian state 39 people are missing, with France 24 attributing this to local authorities. EuroNews reports 43 people are missing. NOS Nieuws reports a less specific \"dozens of people\" are missing.\n\nFRAMING DIFFERENCES:\nThe sources frame the disaster with varying degrees of descriptive language. France 24 and The Guardian use vivid, impactful phrasing to describe the scene, such as \"raging currents of brown water.\" The Guardian also mentions the \"rubble of houses swept away in a landslide.\" This framing emphasizes the destructive power of the event. In contrast, NOS Nieuws and EuroNews use more direct, factual language. NOS Nieuws reports straightforwardly that \"At least thirty people have died\" and \"A state of emergency has been declared,\" focusing on the official status and human cost. EuroNews focuses on the scale and cause, using phrases like \"deadly floods\" and \"record rain.\"\n\nKEY UNKNOWNS:\nThe exact number of missing persons remains unclear due to the conflicting reports. The specific timeline of the rainfall and when the deaths occurred is not fully detailed. While NOS Nieuws mentions Monday evening and The Guardian mentions Tuesday, the precise sequence of events is not established. The full extent of the damage, including the number of homes destroyed and people displaced, is not specified in the provided extractions.
