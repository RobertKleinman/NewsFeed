El Pais English and Merco Press both indicate that US armed forces are ready or preparing for a possible offensive, with El Pais English specifying readiness as early as \"this weekend.\" Radio-Canada and Merco Press both mention ongoing talks or diplomatic engagement between Washington and Tehran, with Radio-Canada stating that two sessions of talks have taken place.

Bloomberg uses neutral, factual language, focusing on economic impacts (\"Oil steadied near a six-month high\") and directly quoting Trump's ultimatum (\"15 days at most\"), without editorializing.

          "investigation_raw": "1. WHAT I FOUND:\nRecent reporting confirms that President Trump has issued a 10 to 15-day ultimatum to Iran to agree to a nuclear deal, threatening unspecified but serious consequences if they fail to do so. This ultimatum is backed by a significant U.S. military buildup in the Middle East, with reports suggesting forces could be ready for a strike as early as this weekend, though a final decision has not been made. The so-called \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza recently held its inaugural meeting where Trump announced a $10 billion U.S. contribution for Gaza's reconstruction and security as part of a U.N.-endorsed peace plan. Recent nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran in Geneva ended without a breakthrough, with both sides remaining \"very far apart\". Criticism of Trump's economic policies includes new sanctions on Cuba, which Russia has condemned, and the use of tariffs to pressure India over its purchase of Russian oil.\n\n2. DOES THIS CHANGE THE STORY?\nYES \u2014 The new information provides crucial context and clarifies several key aspects of the initial reports. It specifies that the \"deal\" offered to Iran is a nuclear agreement requiring a halt to uranium enrichment. It also details the \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza, revealing its formal establishment, leadership, funding pledges from the U.S. and other nations, and its mandate to oversee a peace and reconstruction plan. Furthermore, the research confirms the recent U.S.-Iran talks in Geneva, clarifying that they were part of the ongoing diplomatic efforts that have so far failed to produce a resolution.\n\n3. IF YES \u2014 STORY IMPACT:\nThe reader should now understand that the ultimatum to Iran is specifically tied to a nuclear deal and is occurring in the context of recent, unsuccessful diplomatic talks. Additionally, the \"Board of Peace\" is a newly formed, funded, and operational entity with a specific mission in Gaza, not just a concept.",

The Telegraph refers to \"three days of absolute horror,\" while The Guardian mentions an \"18-month occupation.\"\n\nDISAGREEMENTS:\nNo substantive contradictions identified.\n\nFRAMING DIFFERENCES:\nSources use different terminology from the UN report to frame the severity of the RSF's actions, though all point to the same conclusion.\n\nRadio-Canada's framing is the most direct and legally specific, stating the UN mission \"denounces 'acts of genocide'\" and found \"genocidal intent.\" This focuses on the legal definition of the crime.\n\nThe Telegraph, The Guardian, and DW News all frame the story using the UN mission's phrase \"hallmarks of genocide.\" This suggests actions that are characteristic of genocide without necessarily being a final legal declaration of it.\n\nThe Telegraph and The Guardian also use their own editorial framing to convey the humanitarian crisis. The Telegraph uses the word \"massacred\" to describe the killings and quotes investigators calling it \"three days of absolute horror.\" The Guardian describes a \"harrowing 18-month occupation.\" DW News offers more straightforward framing, leading with the \"hallmarks of genocide\" quote.\n\nKEY UNKNOWNS:\nThe extractions do not clarify the exact relationship between the \"three days of absolute horror\" mentioned by The Telegraph and the \"18-month occupation\" mentioned by The Guardian. It is unclear if the three days refer to a specific event, like the city's final capture, within the longer occupation period. The precise number of casualties is not specified, with The Telegraph only stating that \"thousands of people are thought to have been massacred.\" The specific \"other crimes\" mentioned in the graphic footage reported by DW News are not detailed.",
            "ChatGPT": "AGREED FACTS:\nRadio-Canada, The Guardian, and DW News all report that a UN or UN-mandated fact-finding mission found that the actions of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in El-Fasher bore the \"hallmarks of genocide\" or constituted \"acts of genocide.\" All four sources (Radio-Canada, The Telegraph, The Guardian, DW News) agree that the RSF was responsible for severe violence in El-Fasher, Sudan, and that these events were the subject of an official investigation by a UN or independent fact-finding mission. The Guardian and DW News specify that the RSF's capture of El-Fasher is central to the findings. The Telegraph, The Guardian, and DW News all mention a large-scale massacre or mass killings in El-Fasher, with The Telegraph and DW News referencing thousands of victims and graphic evidence. All sources attribute the findings or statements about genocide or its hallmarks to an official UN or independent fact-finding mission.\n\nDISAGREEMENTS:\nNo substantive contradictions identified. All sources agree on the core facts: the RSF's actions in El-Fasher have been characterized by a UN or independent fact-finding mission as bearing the \"hallmarks of genocide\" or as \"acts of genocide,\" and that mass violence occurred.\n\nFRAMING DIFFERENCES:\nRadio-Canada uses strong legal language, emphasizing \"genocidal intent\" and \"acts of genocide\" and directly attributes these to the UN Fact-Finding Mission, framing the events as clear-cut genocide and focusing on legal classification and severity. The Telegraph emphasizes the horror and scale of the violence, using phrases like \"thousands... massacred\" and \"three days of absolute horror,\" and frames the events as having the \"hallmarks of genocide\" according to \"UN-backed investigators,\" focusing on the human cost and emotional impact. The Guardian combines legal and humanitarian framing, highlighting both the \"hallmarks of genocide\" and the \"harrowing 18-month occupation,\" and stresses deliberate actions by the RSF and allied militias, focusing on ethnic targeting and the prolonged nature of the violence. DW News reports the findings in a straightforward manner, quoting the \"hallmarks of genocide\" phrase and linking it to the RSF's capture of El-Fasher, with mention of graphic evidence, but with less emotive or legalistic framing than Radio-Canada or The Telegraph.\n\nKEY UNKNOWNS:\nThe precise legal threshold reached by the UN Fact-Finding Mission\u2014whether it formally declared genocide or only that the events bore its \"hallmarks.\" The exact number of victims and the full extent of the atrocities remain unclear. The specific evidence and methodology used by the fact-finding mission to reach its conclusions are not detailed. The current situation in El-Fasher and the fate of survivors are not addressed. The broader international response or consequences for the RSF or Sudanese authorities are not discussed."

          "investigation_raw": "1. WHAT I FOUND:\nThe UN Fact-Finding Mission for the Sudan concluded that the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) committed acts of genocide against non-Arab communities during their siege and capture of El-Fasher in North Darfur. The final takeover in October 2025 was preceded by an 18-month siege that deliberately weakened the population through starvation and deprivation. The period immediately following the city's fall was described as \"three days of absolute horror,\" during which widespread, ethnically targeted killings, sexual violence, and torture occurred. The mission's findings were based on interviews with 320 witnesses, investigative visits, and the verification of video and satellite imagery. A UN Human Rights Office report estimated that at least 6,000 people were killed in the first 72 hours after the takeover.\n\n2. DOES THIS CHANGE THE STORY?\nYES \u2014 The research clarifies the legal threshold crossed and the relationship between different phases of the violence, adding significant weight to the initial reports. The UN mission did not merely find \"hallmarks\" of genocide; it concluded that at least three underlying acts of genocide were committed with \"genocidal intent\" to destroy the Zaghawa and Fur communities in whole or in part. Furthermore, the research clarifies that the \"three days of absolute horror\" were the culmination of a deliberate 18-month siege designed to weaken the population before the final, brutal assault.\n\n3. IF YES \u2014 STORY IMPACT:\nThe reader should understand that the events in El-Fasher were not just a brutal capture of a city, but a systematic campaign with the clear intent of genocide, as concluded by a UN body. The atrocities were the final phase of a long-term strategy of siege and starvation, making the RSF's actions appear more calculated and organized than the initial coverage might have suggested.",

          "investigation_raw": "WHAT I FOUND:\nMy research confirms that on Thursday, February 19, 2026, Google announced Gemini 3.1 Pro. The \"2X+ reasoning performance boost\" claim is based on the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark, where the new model scored 77.1%, more than double the 31.1% of its predecessor, Gemini 3 Pro. This new model is being rolled out in preview to consumers and developers, with pricing for the API set at $2.00 per 1M input tokens and $12.00 per 1M output tokens, the same as the previous version. Independent analysis from \"Artificial Analysis\" corroborates some of Google's claims, ranking Gemini 3.1 Pro as a leading model in intelligence and coding, though it notes that competitors still lead in some agentic tasks.\n\nDOES THIS CHANGE THE STORY?\nYES \u2014 The research fills in crucial details that were missing from the initial coverage, providing a more complete and nuanced picture of the event. The initial gaps in coverage concerned the specifics of the \"2X+ reasoning performance boost,\" the benchmarks used, the cost and availability of the model, and the lack of independent verification. My findings directly address all of these points. Specifically, identifying the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark as the source of the \"2X+\" claim gives substance to Google's headline assertion. Furthermore, the inclusion of pricing and availability details provides a practical context for users and developers. Most importantly, the preliminary independent analysis from \"Artificial Analysis\" offers an initial, albeit not exhaustive, validation of Google's claims, moving the story from a simple announcement to a more credible technological advancement. While not a direct contradiction, this added information materially changes how a reader should understand the significance and veracity of Google's announcement.\n\nIF YES \u2014 STORY IMPACT:\nThe reader should now understand that Google's claims of a significant performance boost are tied to specific, verifiable benchmarks and are not just marketing hyperbole.

The Guardian, Al Jazeera, DW News, and the South China Morning Post all mention this organization.\n\nThree sources confirm that troops will be sent to Gaza as part of this initiative. The Guardian mentions an \"International Stabilization Force\" composed of \"pledged troops.\" DW News reports that Indonesia will \"send troops to Gaza.\"\n\nTwo sources connect Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto to the Board of Peace. DW News reports that Indonesia will join the Board of Peace and quotes President Subianto. The South China Morning Post states that President Subianto was in Washington for a meeting of President Donald Trump's \"Board of Peace\".\n\nDISAGREEMENTS:\nNo substantive contradictions identified.\n\nFRAMING DIFFERENCES:\nThe sources frame the story around different aspects of the same broader initiative.\n\nThe Guardian frames its report as an \"Exclusive\" investigation into a specific, large-scale US military construction project in Gaza. It uses phrases like \"Trump officials plan to build\" and describes a base \"sprawling more than 350 acres\" to emphasize the scale and US-led nature of the plan.\n\nDW News frames its story around the geopolitical implications for a participating country, asking \"Why is Indonesia offering to send thousands of troops into Gaza?\" and calling it a \"risky move politically.\" This focuses on the motivations and domestic consequences for Indonesia.\n\nAl Jazeera frames its report around the financial contributions to the initiative, headlining with \"Qatar pledges $1bn for Gaza peace mission.\" This centers the story on the role of a key regional financial backer.\n\nThe South China Morning Post frames its story around a bilateral economic deal connected to the initiative. It reports that \"Indonesia seals \u2018great\u2019 US trade deal\" while its president was in Washington for a \"Board of Peace\" meeting, linking diplomatic participation with economic outcomes.\n\nKEY UNKNOWNS:\nThe provided extractions do not specify what the \"Board of Peace\" is, how it was formed, or which other countries besides Indonesia and Qatar are involved. The exact nature of the \"International Stabilization Force,\" its mandate, and which nations have pledged troops are not detailed. The timeline for the construction of the military base and the deployment of troops is not mentioned.

Both The Guardian and DW News state that Indonesia is involved with the Board of Peace and that Indonesia plans to send troops to Gaza. The Guardian and South China Morning Post both report that President Prabowo Subianto attended a meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington. All sources that mention the Board of Peace (The Guardian, DW News, South China Morning Post) agree it is connected to multinational or international involvement in Gaza.\n\nDISAGREEMENTS:\nNo substantive contradictions identified. The sources cover different aspects of the story (military base planning, financial pledges, troop contributions, trade agreements) but do not make incompatible claims about the same facts.\n\nFRAMING DIFFERENCES:\nThe Guardian frames its coverage as an \"Exclusive,\" emphasizing the scale and significance of the planned military base with phrases like \"Trump officials plan to build\" and \"sprawling more than 350 acres.\" It highlights the multinational nature of the planned force and the uniqueness of its reporting (\"according to records reviewed by the Guardian\"). DW News frames Indonesia's involvement as a \"politically risky move,\" focusing on the domestic and diplomatic implications for Indonesia, especially given its lack of official relations with Israel. The headline \"Why is Indonesia offering to send thousands of troops into Gaza?\" centers the story on Indonesia's motivations and risks. South China Morning Post frames its report around the economic and diplomatic relationship between the US and Indonesia, using neutral language and focusing on the details of a reciprocal trade agreement. The phrase \"Indonesia seals \u2018great\u2019 US trade deal\" suggests a positive outcome but is not further editorialized in the body. Al Jazeera (based on the extraction) frames its story around Qatar's financial pledge, with the headline \"Qatar pledges $1bn for Gaza peace mission\" emphasizing the monetary contribution.\n\nKEY UNKNOWNS:\nIt is unclear whether the proposed 5,000-person military base in Gaza is officially approved or still in the planning stages, and whether it has the support of all relevant governments. The precise mandate, composition, and timeline for the International Stabilization Force (ISF) remain unspecified. The relationship between the Board of Peace and existing international bodies or peacekeeping frameworks is not clarified. The extent of coordination or agreement between the Trump administration, Indonesia, Qatar, and other potential contributors to the ISF is not detailed. The full scope and terms of Qatar's $1 billion pledge, and how it will be used in practice, are not explained. The extractions do not clarify whether the trade agreement between the US and Indonesia is directly linked to Indonesia's participation in the Board of Peace or the Gaza mission."

The Wall Street Journal states that U.S. tariff threats are growing and that Germany is focused on exports, while Corriere della Sera EN reports that European exporters are at risk from U.S. tariffs and that U.S. duties on specific products (oil, wine, pasta) put exports at risk. Both sources agree that U.S. tariffs are a significant external factor affecting European economies reliant on exports.\n\nDISAGREEMENTS:\nNo substantive contradictions identified.

El Pais English and CBC News both refer to the administration's actions as an \"immigration crackdown.\"\n\nDISAGREEMENTS:\nNo substantive contradictions identified.\n\nFRAMING DIFFERENCES:\nThe sources frame the Trump administration's immigration policies from different angles.\n\nMiddle East Eye frames the policy as a direct attack on legally admitted individuals, using the headline \"Trump administration gives ICE power to indefinitely detain legal refugees in US.\" The phrase \"indefinitely detain\" highlights the severity and open-ended nature of the policy, while \"legal refugees\" emphasizes that it affects those who have followed legal processes.\n\nEl Pais English frames the situation as a political conflict, holding the administration responsible for a government shutdown. Its headline, \"The White House\u2019s resistance to reforming ICE prolongs the Department of Homeland Security shutdown,\" places blame on the White House. It also describes the political strategy of the opposition, stating \"Democrats are using the standoff...to highlight their opposition to Trump\u2019s immigration policy.\"\n\nCBC News frames the story through a legal and judicial lens, focusing on a rebuke of the administration's policies. While its headline uses strong, quoted language (\"accuses Trump administration of 'terror' against immigrants\"), the article's own framing is more neutral, stating a judge \"has thrown out an administrative board's decision\" regarding \"mandatory detention.\"\n\nWall Street Journal frames the immigration actions as a fulfillment of a presidential agenda. It uses neutral, factual language, stating \"The president has made immigration an early priority to start second term,\" which presents the crackdown as a planned policy initiative rather than a controversial action.\n\nKEY UNKNOWNS:\nThe provided extractions do not specify the connection between the DHS shutdown mentioned by El Pais English and the specific ICE policies detailed by the other sources. It is unclear if the shutdown is a direct result of the policy allowing indefinite detention of refugees or the broader immigration crackdown. The sources do not mention a crackdown on pro-Palestinian organizations, leaving that part of the initial query unaddressed. The specific date of the \"more than 900 arrests\" mentioned by the Wall Street Journal is not fully clarified beyond \"Sunday.\"",
            "ChatGPT": "AGREED FACTS:\nMultiple sources confirm that the Trump administration prioritized immigration enforcement policies and that these policies led to increased detention and enforcement actions by ICE. The Wall Street Journal reports that immigration was an early priority for the president's second term and that ICE made over 900 arrests on a specific Sunday. Middle East Eye states that the Trump administration gave ICE the power to indefinitely detain legal refugees under certain conditions. CBC News reports that a U.S. federal judge intervened against a Trump administration policy involving mandatory detention of thousands of people during an immigration crackdown. All sources agree that there was a significant focus on immigration enforcement and detention under the Trump administration.\n\nDISAGREEMENTS:\nNo substantive contradictions identified. The sources cover different aspects of the Trump administration's immigration policies and related events but do not make incompatible claims about the same facts.\n\nFRAMING DIFFERENCES:\nEl Pais English frames the situation as a political standoff, emphasizing \"the White House\u2019s resistance to reforming ICE\" and highlighting Democrats' opposition to Trump\u2019s immigration policy. The article attributes the prolonged DHS shutdown to the White House and focuses on political strategy.\n\nMiddle East Eye frames the issue as a negative development for legal refugees, using phrases like \"gives ICE power to indefinitely detain legal refugees\" and emphasizing the open-ended nature of detention for those not obtaining a green card within a year.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal uses neutral, factual language, describing immigration as \"an early priority to start second term\" and reporting on the number of ICE arrests without editorializing.\n\nCBC News frames the Trump administration's immigration crackdown critically in the headline, using language such as \"accuses Trump administration of 'terror' against immigrants\" and \"vacates ruling on mass detention,\" but the article body is more neutral, simply stating that a judge \"has thrown out an administrative board's decision.\"\n\nKEY UNKNOWNS:\nIt is unclear from the provided extractions whether the ICE policy of indefinite detention for legal refugees is still in effect following the federal judge's intervention reported by CBC News. The specific legal or practical impact of the judge's decision on ongoing or future detentions is not addressed. There is no direct evidence in the extractions about a crackdown on pro-Palestinian organizations, despite this being mentioned in the user prompt. The precise reasons for the DHS shutdown, its duration, and its broader consequences are also not fully explained. Additionally, the scale and conditions of detention, as well as the experiences of those affected, remain unreported in these extractions."
